			<h3>The Path Connecting the City With Nature</h3>
			<p>Hello and welcome to ESYBYLM. </p>
			<p>My name is Erinn and I live in Hamburg, Germany but originally from the United States. I grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on the shore of Lake Superior surrounded by the natural beauty of the Porcupine Mountains and the Ottawa National Forest. Although I was part of the land I had not yet learned to appreciate it and longed to see the world and all the places that looked so exotic and so much more beautiful than my little corner of the world. So I travelled to the big city as soon as I got the chance. In Chicago I got a Liberal Arts degree from DePaul University with an intent to make a career in the Arts but my wander lust got the best of me and I soon found myself in the Pacific Northwest enjoying the natural beauty and making pretty good money on the side as a Project Manager in software development. My Art never took a backseat but it wasn't going to finance my adventures for awhile. Travelling through Mexico, Central America and Europe gave me a wide understand of the world and the opportunity to share my life with so many wonderful people but it also made me realize the unique beauty in the place I was from, how special it was. For the next few years I explored the beauty of the country I was from, from the west coast to the east coast, the desert and the prairies. </p>
			<p>Now I am on to a new adventure with a relocation to Germany. It's a good time to put my collections together and share them with the world.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>My Art focuses on natural elements in conjunction with the urban environment. I like finding the round organic forms in architecture and the abstract blunt lines in nature and exploring the combined beauty of both. As we continue to increase our focus on urbanization, global warming and the shrinking of natural habitat around the globe, it is important to recognize the beauty no only in our remote landscapes but also in our growing urban habitats and the necessity of incorporating nature within the design of our modern cities. </p>

			<h3>Participation</h3>
			<p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/" title="A listing of CSS-related resources"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
			<p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
			<p>Download the sample <a href="/examples/index" title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.">HTML</a> and <a href="/examples/style.css" title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/" title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

			<h3 class="select">Requirements:</h3>
			<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
